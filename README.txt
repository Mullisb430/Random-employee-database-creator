    This is a Python program that generates a database of 2,000 random employees. The generated employees
will have an ID, a full name, an email address (sometimes email will be based on the employee's name), a salary, 
a gender, and a hire date. The program generates 2,000 employees by default, however that can be adjusted. 
The database created will be stored inside the working directory (.db). To run the program, use the 'Main.py' 
file.
